## Introduction

Welcome to my project, a specialized application tailored for the analysis and visualization of complex relationships in German legal texts. My endeavor integrates advanced natural language processing and graph theory to provide a structured and interactive representation of legal documents. The project is divided into two key phases: the construction of a knowledge graph and its application in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for enriched language model responses by grounding it in a domain specific area of legal expertise.

## Objectives

1. **Knowledge Graph Creation:** The initial phase involves processing legal texts to develop a comprehensive knowledge graph. This graph visualizes key concepts and their interconnections, offering a detailed map of the legal textual environment.

2. **Context-Enriched RAG System:** The ultimate goal of the project is to leverage the knowledge graph in a RAG system. This system enriches and improves the context used in language model responses, ensuring they are grounded in domain-specific legal expertise. It represents a significant step towards more accurate and context-aware responses in legal text analysis.

## Key Features

- Semantic text splitting for in-depth analysis of legal texts.
- Interactive knowledge graph construction from legal documents.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for cutting-edge NLP capabilities.
- Network graph analysis and visualization for elucidating textual relationships.
- Use of vector space modeling for analyzing text and graph components.
- Contextual analysis techniques, including TF-IDF scoring and cosine similarity, for enhanced understanding.
- Application of the knowledge graph in a RAG system for context-rich language model responses.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TilmanLudewigtHaufe/Graph_Augmented_RAG.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
   - Install required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`.

4. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your text data in the `data_input` directory.

Certainly! I'll adjust the "Running the Application" section to reflect these steps.

## Usage

### Generating the Knowledge Graph

1. **Creating the Knowledge Graph:**
   - Run the `networkX.py` script to generate the knowledge graph from your text data.
     ```
     python networkX.py
     ```
   - This process analyzes the text, constructs a graph of interconnected concepts, and saves the graph data.

2. **Visualizing the Knowledge Graph:**
   - After running `networkX.py`, open `docs/index.html` in a web browser.
   - This file contains an interactive visualization of the knowledge graph, allowing you to explore the relationships and structures within your data.

### Running Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation

1. **Executing the Main Script:**
   - To engage with the graph-augmented retrieval and generation capabilities, run the `Graph_RAG_advanced_RAG.py` script.
     ```
     python Graph_RAG_advanced_RAG.py
     ```
   - This script uses the knowledge graph to enhance text retrieval and generation, providing deeper insights and context for user queries.

2. **Interacting with the System:**
   - Enter queries at the prompt within the `Graph_RAG_advanced_RAG.py` script interface.
   - Use commands like `quit`, `q`, or `exit` to end the interactive session.

3. **Analyzing Outputs:**
   - The application provides responses based on the knowledge graph and the augmented retrieval mechanism, offering a rich and contextual understanding of the query topics.
   - Check the output on the console and any generated files in the `data_output` directory for detailed insights.

### Note

- Ensure that the `networkX.py` script is executed before running `Graph_RAG_advanced_RAG.py`, as the latter depends on the knowledge graph generated by the former.
